  my $control = MIDI::RtController->new(
    input  => 'keyboard',
    output => 'usb',
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<MIDI::RtController::Filter::CC> is a (growing) collection of
control-change based L<MIDI::RtController> filters.

Passing C<all> to the C<add_filter> method means that any MIDI event
will trigger the filter.

=head2 Making filters

All filter methods must accept the object, a MIDI device name, a
delta-time, and a MIDI event ARRAY reference, like:

  sub breathe ($self, $device, $delta, $event) {
    return 0 if $self->running;
    my ($event_type, $chan, $control, $value) = $event->@*;
    ...
    return $boolean;
  }

A filter also must return a boolean value. This tells
L<MIDI::RtController> to continue processing other known filters or
not.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 rtc

  $rtc = $filter->rtc;

The required L<MIDI::RtController> instance provided in the
constructor.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  $filter = MIDI::RtController::Filter::CC->new(%arguments);

Return a new C<MIDI::RtController::Filter::CC> object.

=head1 UTILITIES

=head2 add_filters

  MIDI::RtController::Filter::CC::add_filters(\@filters, $controllers);

Add an array reference of B<filters> to controller instances. For
example:

  [
    { # mod-wheel
      port => 'keyboard',        # what is controlling it
      type => 'breathe',         # the type of filter
      event => 'control_change', # or [qw(note_on note_off)] etc
      control => 1,              # what is being controlled
      trigger => 25,             # what triggers the controlling
      time_step => 0.25,          # a parameter
    },
    ...
  ]

In this list, C<port> and C<type> are required, and C<event> is
optional. These keys are metadata, and all others are assumed to be
object attributes to set.

The B<controllers> come from L<MIDI::RtController/open_controllers>
and is a hash reference of C<MIDI::RtController> instances keyed by a
MIDI input device port name.

=cut

sub add_filters ($filters, $controllers) {
    for my $params (@$filters) {
        my $port = delete $params->{port};
        next unless $port; # skip unnamed entries
        my $type = delete $params->{type} || 'single';
        my $event = delete $params->{event} || 'all';
        my $filter = __PACKAGE__->new(
            rtc => $controllers->{$port}
        );
        for my $param (keys %$params) {
            $filter->$param($params->{$param});
        }
        my $method = "curry::$type";
        $controllers->{$port}->add_filter($type, $event => $filter->$method);
    }
}

=head1 FILTERS

=head2 single

  $control->add_filter('single', all => $filter->curry::single);

This filter sets a single B<control> change message, over the MIDI
B<channel> once.

If B<trigger> is set, the filter checks that against the MIDI event
C<note> to see if the filter should be applied.

=cut

sub single ($self, $device, $dt, $event) {
    my ($ev, $chan, $note, $val) = $event->@*;
    return 0 if defined $self->trigger && $note != $self->trigger;

    my $value = $self->value || $val;
    my $cc = [ 'control_change', $self->channel, $self->control, $value ];
    $self->rtc->send_it($cc);
    return 1;
}

=head2 breathe

  $control->add_filter('breathe', all => $filter->curry::breathe);

This filter sets the B<running> flag, then iterates between the
B<range_bottom> and B<range_top> by B<range_step> increments, sending
a B<control> change message, over the MIDI B<channel> every iteration.

Passing C<all> means that any MIDI event will cause this filter to be
triggered.

If B<trigger> or B<value> is set, the filter checks those against the
MIDI event C<note> or C<value>, respectively, to see if the filter
should be applied.

=cut

sub breathe ($self, $device, $dt, $event) {
    return 0 if $self->running;

    my ($ev, $chan, $note, $val) = $event->@*;
    return 0 if defined $self->trigger && $note != $self->trigger;
    return 0 if defined $self->value && $val != $self->value;

    $self->running(1);

    my $it = Iterator::Breathe->new(
        bottom => $self->range_bottom,
        top    => $self->range_top,
        step   => $self->range_step,
    );

    $self->rtc->loop->add(
        IO::Async::Timer::Periodic->new(
            interval  => $self->time_step,
            on_tick => sub {
                $it->iterate;
                my $cc = [ 'control_change', $self->channel, $self->control, $it->i ];
                $self->rtc->send_it($cc);
            },
        )->start
    );

    return 0;
}

=head2 scatter

  $control->add_filter('scatter', all => $filter->curry::scatter);

This filter sets the B<running> flag, chooses a random number between
the B<range_bottom> and B<range_top>, and sends that as the value of a
B<control> change message, over the MIDI B<channel>, every iteration.

The B<initial_point> is used as the first CC# message, then the
randomization takes over.

If B<trigger> or B<value> is set, the filter checks those against the
MIDI event C<note> or C<value>, respectively, to see if the filter
should be applied.

=cut

sub scatter ($self, $device, $dt, $event) {
    return 0 if $self->running;

    my ($ev, $chan, $note, $val) = $event->@*;
    return 0 if defined $self->trigger && $note != $self->trigger;
    return 0 if defined $self->value && $val != $self->value;

    $self->running(1);

    my $value  = $self->initial_point;
    my @values = ($self->range_bottom .. $self->range_top);

    $self->rtc->loop->add(
        IO::Async::Timer::Periodic->new(
            interval  => $self->time_step,
            on_tick => sub {
                my $cc = [ 'control_change', $self->channel, $self->control, $value ];
                $self->rtc->send_it($cc);
                $value = $values[ int rand @values ];
            },
        )->start
    );

    return 0;
}

=head2 stair_step

  $control->add_filter('stair_step', all => $filter->curry::stair_step);

This filter sets the B<running> flag, uses the B<initial_point> for
the fist CC# message, then adds B<step_up> or subtracts B<step_down>
from that number successively, sending the value as a B<control>
change message, over the MIDI B<channel>, every iteration.

If B<trigger> or B<value> is set, the filter checks those against the
MIDI event C<note> or C<value>, respectively, to see if the filter
should be applied.

=cut

sub stair_step ($self, $device, $dt, $event) {
    return 0 if $self->running;

    my ($ev, $chan, $note, $val) = $event->@*;
    return 0 if defined $self->trigger && $note != $self->trigger;
    return 0 if defined $self->value && $val != $self->value;

    $self->running(1);

    my $it = Iterator::Breathe->new(
        bottom => $self->range_bottom,
        top    => $self->range_top,
    );

    my $value     = $self->initial_point;
    my $direction = 1; # up

    $self->rtc->loop->add(
        IO::Async::Timer::Periodic->new(
            interval  => $self->time_step,
            on_tick => sub {
                my $cc = [ 'control_change', $self->channel, $self->control, $value ];
                $self->rtc->send_it($cc);

                # compute the stair-stepping
                if ($direction) {
                    $it->step($self->step_up);
                }
                else {
                    $it->step(- $self->step_down);
                }

                # toggle the stair-step direction
                $direction = !$direction;

                # iterate the breathing

                $value = $self->range_bottom if $value <= $self->range_bottom;
            },
        )->start
    );
    return 0;
}

=head2 ramp_up

  $control->add_filter('ramp_up', all => $filter->curry::ramp_up);

This filter ramps-up a B<control> change message, over the MIDI
B<channel>, from B<range_bottom> until the B<range_top> is reached.

If B<trigger> or B<value> is set, the filter checks those against the
MIDI event C<note> or C<value>, respectively, to see if the filter
should be applied.
